<h1>Modular Synthesis as an Educational Tool </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This repository documents my contributions to my Senior Design Capstone project at LSU: Modular Synthesis as an Educational Tool. As a cosponsor of this project, my team set out to create a mixed analog and digital modular synthesizer to be used alongside courses such as Electronics, Signals and Systems, and Digital Signal Processing. Our system strives to be a physical and tangible example of applications of concepts learned in these courses.

<h2>System Overview</h2>
The final system consists of 7 synthesizer modules, a power supply, and a wooden case. The modules included are:
  Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) : Generates basic waveforms and allows users to manipulate fundamental frequency
  Voltage Controlled Filter (VCF) : High and Low Pass filters allow users to filter out frequency content from frequency rich signals
  Digital Multi-Effects (DME) : Processes incoming audio with various digital effects via DSP algorithms
  Level Control Module (LCM) : Brings output voltage from other modules down to appropriate level for analysis via National Instruments MyDAQ or active speakers
  Envelope Generator (EG) : Produces a control voltage Attack Decay (AD) or Attack Release (AR) envelope for use in manipulating other modules.
  Sequencer (SEQ) : Produces repeating pattern of control voltages to create melodies and rhythms
  Wireless Control Module (WCM) : Allows users to wireless control parameters via control voltages from a mobile application

<h2>My Contribution</h2>
As the Computer Engineer of the team, my responsibilities were to create the Digital Multi-Effects (DME) and the Wireless Control Module (WCM). Material for each can be found in their respective folders.
